# Project 01 - [REVIEW NAME - Guild Wars 2]

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop an original responsive webpage as a team using concepts learned in class over the previous several weeks. The main concepts for this integration are to:
1) Incorporate two or more [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
2) Utilize client-side storage.
3) Design the page with a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
4) Allow user to interact with webpage.

Other points of interest within the acceptance criteria are to follow best practices as discussed in class. For example:
1) Have a polished User Interface (UI).
2) Do not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
3) Deploy the webpage to GitHub Pages.

## Description

The webpage waits for a user to input their Guild Wars 2 API. On "Submit" the webpage will display the amount of gold and gems the user has accumulated in the game; convert the game currency into USD; allows the user to select one of 15 currencies in the dropdown; and converts USD into the user-selected currency.

Each API entered is saved into local storage for quick recall by the user in the future.
